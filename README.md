# WorkingGuidelines
Everything I want my team members to know about working for me.

## Working with Jacob
- If you think I am wrong, I probably am; tell me why.

## Work Schedule
`Don't fret too much on exact start and end times for the day. As long as you are getting your work done and not missing meetings you are doing fine.`

## Communication
- Prefer Slack over email
