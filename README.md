# WorkingGuidelines
Everything I want my team members to know about working for me.

## Working with Jacob
[Here is a collection of articles](articles.md) that have influenced the way I think. It may be easier to work with me if you understanding how I approach problems and why.
That being said:
- If you think I am wrong, I probably am; tell me why.

## Work Schedule
Don't fret too much on exact start and end times for the day. As long as you are getting your work done and not missing meetings you are doing fine.

Make every attempt to set a [Maker's Schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) and defend it. As your leader it is my responsibility to help you have the space to do and make great things. If there are things blocking you, let me know as soon as possible. 

## Communication
- Prefer Slack over email
  - Set you office hours in Slack and email
  - Schedule time to read Slack, don't feel obligated to respond to every message right away
- If I message you (after hours, before hours, on the weekend, or while you are at lunch), I do not expect you to respond until you are back at work. The exception is if you are on call or an incident has been escalated to you.
  - This is true even if I sound urgent. A lack of planning on my part does not make an emergency for you.
