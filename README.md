# WorkingGuidelines
Everything I want my team members to know about working for me.

## Working with Jacob
[Here is a collection of articles](articles.md) that have influenced the way I think. It may be easier to work with me if you understanding how I approach problems and why.
That being said:
- If you think I am wrong, I probably am; tell me why.

## Work Schedule
`Don't fret too much on exact start and end times for the day. As long as you are getting your work done and not missing meetings you are doing fine.`

## Communication
- Prefer Slack over email
- If i message you (after hours, before hours, on the weekend, or while you are at lunch), I do not expect you to respond until you are back at work. The exception is if you are on call or an incident has been escalated to you.
  - This is true even if I sound urgent. A lack of planning on my part does not make an emergency for you.
